[[EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)]] instance customization -> software, config, os, monitoring
Benefit faster boot and config time, built for specific region and can be copied across region
We can launch EC2 from:
1. Public AMI :  From AWS
2. Our own AMI : From us
3. Marketplace AMI : third party / buy from others

##### Process
1. Start EC2 instance and customize it
2. Stop the instance
3. Build AMI -> create EBS snapshots
4. Launch instances from other AMI

AMI as templating from EC2, so we can just create from AMI, and do some functionality over it
