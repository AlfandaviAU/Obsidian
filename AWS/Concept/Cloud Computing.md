Server consist of :
1. Compute : CPU -> Do some computations
2. Memory: RAM -> How many process can be done in same time
3. Storage : Data -> Save the process
4. Database : Store data in a structured way -> sql or nosql
5. Network : Router, switch, DNS server

Computer -> Router -> Switch -> Computer2, Computer3, Computer4

Garage -> Office (has Data Center)
Data center -> Infrastructure bunch of computers -> Problem with this approach : 
1. Pay rent for data center
2. Pay for power suppy, cooling, maintenance
3. Adding and replacing hardware takes time
4. Scaling is limited
5. Hire team to monitor infra
6. Disaster dealing

#### Cloud Computing
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">on-demand</mark> delivery computer power, we can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pay-as-you-go</mark> pricing, choose the right type and size of computing resources we need, allows to adapt size we need, we can access as many resources instantly, easily access servers, storage, db and all services.

Office -> The Cloud (multiple servers) we can pay as we go
Example of cloud services:
1. Gmail (email cloud service)
2. Dropbox (Cloud storage service, built on AWS)
3. Netflix (Video on Demand, built on AWS)
##### Deployment Models
1. Private Cloud : Used by single org, not exposed, complete control, security for sensitive app, nice business needs
2. Public Cloud : Owned by 3rd party cloud service provider, had 6 advantages of cloud computing
	1. Microsoft Azure
	2. Google Cloud
	3. Amazon Web Services, and etc
3. Hybrid Cloud : Keep some server on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud, 50:50

##### 5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. On-demand self service 
	1. user can set resource, dan self service
2. Broad network access 
	1. Resources available over the network
3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling 
	1. Customers can share the same infra, with security and privacy, shared physical resources
4. Rapid elasticity and scalability
	1. Automatically acquire/dispose resource when needed, easy scalability
5. Measured service
	1. Usage is measured

##### 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing
1. Trade CAPEX to OPEX (Pay on Demand -> Rent)
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale -> more efficient
3. Stop guessing capacity -> can scale on actual measured usage
4. Increased speed and agility
5. Stop spending money running and maintain data center
6. Go global in minutes

##### Problems Solved
1. Flexibility
2. Cost-Effectiveness
3. Scalability
4. Elasticity
5. High-availability and fault-tolerance
6. Agility

##### Types of Cloud Computing [[AWS Type]]
1. IaaS (Infra as a Service)
	1. Provide building blocks for cloud IT
2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
	1. Focus on deployment and management of app
3. SaaS (Software as a Service)\
