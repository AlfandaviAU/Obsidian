	4. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Most cost-efficient instance in AWS</mark>

		3. Image processing
		4. Any distributed workloads
		6. Workloads with flexible start and end time
	7. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Not suitable for critical jobs or DB</mark>

6. **Dedicated Instances** -> Book entire hardware, not sharing with others
	1. Instance run on hardware that dedicated to us
	2. Share hardware with other instances
	3. No control over instance placement

7. **Capacity Reservations** -> Reserve capacity in specific for any duration
	1. Reserve on-demand instances capacity for any duration
	2. Always have access to EC2 capacity when we need it
	3. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">No time commmitment, no billing discounts</mark>

##### When to use Reserved Instances vs Saving Plans?
1. Reserved instances locked at same Region and Instance family
2. RI is commitment to use an instance  at particular price for specific period
	1. it means that we want to use machine a, for 10 bucks, for 1 year, whether i use it or not
3. Saving Plans is commitment to spend particular dollar amount per hour for specific period
	1. it means that we want to spend 10bucks for any machine, for 1 year

##### Dedicated Instances vs Dedicated Host
![[Pasted image 20240904090452.png|300]]
Key notes : dedicated host -> we buy the whole racks, and dedicated instances -> we buy the instances i.e. 1 hardware and if we stop using it, we may use another hardware, but private use
