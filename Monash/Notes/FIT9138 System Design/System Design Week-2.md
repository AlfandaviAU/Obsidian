SDLC -> provide guidelines for development process
Define who will do the activity and the timeline

##### SDLC Methodologies
1. Provide basis for project planning
	1. Project phases and activities
	2. Deliverables
	3. Milestones
2. Components
	1. Models
	2. Techniques
	3. Tools
##### SDLC Methodologies  - Models
1. Graphical rep (diagrams and charts) of scenario
2. Represent
	1. I/O
	2. Process / activities and flows
	3. Users
	4. Data
	5. Object / Entities
	6. Interactions and Messages
	7. Locations and Networks
##### SDLC Methodologies - Tools
1. Artifacts used to help designer to modelling and carrying out the techniques
2. Tools not important

##### SDLC Examples
1. Traditional Waterfall
	1. Most popular approaches
	2. Sequential
	3. Each step frozen before moving the next step
	4. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Large project and cost a lot of money -> suitable</mark>
	5. Require clear requirements
	6. Easier to implement
	7. Each step have deliverables
		1. Document of user requirements

##### Extreme Programming
1. Write automated test first then develop -> Test First Paradigm
2. Lack of Documentation
3. Pair Programming (may swap places)
	1. Driver
		1. Writes the code
	2. Navigator
		1. Look at more strategic aspect -> potential future issues
